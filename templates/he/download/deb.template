Wine for Ubuntu and Ubuntu derivatives
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_new"><img src="{$root}/images/distro/ubuntu.png" width="50" height="50" alt="Ubuntu Logo" border="0"></a></h1>

<p>Ubuntu and Ubuntu derivatives (such as Kubuntu) obtain software from 
<i>packages</i> which are stored in <i>repositories</i>. Ubuntu's default
repository includes Wine, however if you want to stay up to date with the
latest Wine beta package you can use WineHQ's by following these instructions.
</p>

<h2>Warning: These are beta packages for Ubuntu 10.04 or later</h2>

<p><i>The packages here are beta packages.  This means they will 
periodically suffer from 
<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/RegressionTesting">regressions</a>, and as a result an 
update may break functionality in Wine. If the Wine version provided with Ubuntu
works for you, then you may not want to use these beta packages.</i></p>

<h2>Adding the WineHQ Repository:</h2>

<p>Open the Software Sources menu by going to 
<b>System->Administration->Software Sources</b>.  Then select the <b>Other 
Software</b> tab and click <b>Add</b>.</p>

<p>Then, <b>copy and paste the line below</b>.</p>

<i>ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa</i></p>

<h2>Installing Wine:</h2>

<p>Click close to finish, and then <b>reload the package information</b> when 
prompted. If you have Wine installed already, update manager will offer to
upgrade you to the stable Wine 1.2.  To get the most recent Wine 1.3 beta, you 
must install the <i>wine1.3 package</i> or <a href="apt://wine1.3">click this 
link</a>.</p>

<h2>Upgrading to a new version of Ubuntu</h2>

<p>If you are upgrading the entire system, such as going from Ubuntu 10.04 to 
10.10, you will need to come back to this page and add the repository again. 
The built in update manager will not switch the Wine repository automatically.
</p>

<h2>Alternative Command Line Instructions for Installing Wine:</h2>

<p>It is also possible to add the Wine PPA and install via the terminal. This
may be useful on Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and other Ubuntu derivatives.</p>

<p><i>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa</i></p>

<p>Then update APT's package information by running '<b>sudo apt-get 
update</b>'. You can now install Wine by typing '<b>sudo apt-get 
install wine1.3</b>'.</p>

<p>If you'd like to browse the PPA manually, you can <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa">visit its Launchpad page</a>.</p>
