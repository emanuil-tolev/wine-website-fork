Wine for Debian Sid

<p>Debian-based distributions utilize a special tool for managing packages known as APT.  APT is able to automagically install all of the needed dependencies for a software package, as well as keep the package up to date, by scanning what are known as APT repositories. Debian-based distributions have their own repositories of software that include Wine, however we keep our own repository of the latest available beta packages here for download.</p>

<p><b>Warning: These are beta packages</b><br>
<i>This means they will periodically suffer from <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/RegressionTesting">regressions</a>, and as a result an update may break functionality in Wine.  If the latest stable release of Wine (currently Wine {$config_stable_release}) works for you, then you may not want to use these beta packages.</i></p>

<p>This website has packages for i386 and amd64 architecture.</p>

<p>To install wine packages you must download the .deb files and manually install them. See the page for more details.</p>
