<h1 class="title">Live Community Chat</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode.net</a> hosts multiple IRC
channels for Wine. You can access the chat rooms using an IRC program such as
<a href="http://www.xchat.org/">X-Chat</a> with these settings:</p>

<blockquote>
    <b>Server:</b> irc.freenode.net<br />
    <b>Port:</b> 6667<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Which channel you should pick depends on the issue you want to discuss:</p>
   
<blockquote>
    <b>#winehq:</b> User support and help with running Wine<br />
    <b>#crossover:</b> User support and help with running Crossover<br />
    <b>#winehackers:</b> Development and other ways of contributing to
        Wine<br />
    <b>#winehq-social:</b> Casual, off-topic chats with other community
        members<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Those using Firefox, or any other browser that supports IRC URLs, can join
a chat by clicking on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/winehq">#winehq</a></li>
    <li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/crossover">#crossover</a></li>
    <li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/winehackers">#winehackers</a></li>
    <li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/winehq-social">#winehq-social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to keep discussions focused and as helpful as possible, also try
to research your question some before asking about it on the IRC. The
<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ">Wine FAQ</a>,
<a href="//appdb.winehq.org">AppDB</a>, and
<a href="//www.winehq.org/site/download">download page</a> are all good
resources to check first.</p>

<h2>IRC Rules and Penalties</h2>

<p>Besides not being offensive or blatantly inconsiderate, there are a few
simple rules that everyone is expected to follow on the IRC channels. In most
cases, breaking a rule will be seen as an accident at first and will result in
warnings. After you have used up your warnings though, you will be kicked from
the channel.</p>

<p>If you continue to break a rule after using up your kicks, you will be
banned from the channel for up to 2 hours. Any problems after this will
result in an indefinite ban, which can only be overturned by appeal. If you
want to contest a ban, go to <b>#winehq-social</b> (or the
<a href="mailto:wine-devel@winehq.org">wine-devel mailing list</a> if you've
been banned from <b>#winehq-social</b>), and explain why you believe you were
banned in the first place and why the ban should be lifted.</p>
